"""

Make sure the response is valid JSON.
When you generate the posts, include the name of the property, {!$Input:Property.Name}, and explain the characteristics of the house, such as {!$Input:Property.Baths__c}, {!$Input:Property.Beds__c}and{!$Input:Property.Price__c}. Also include a link to the picture of the property, {!$Input:Property.Picture__c}. 

The twitter post should include emojis.
The linkedin post should include several emojis and bullets, and also have a special output formatting: Text render environment only supports Unicode and emoji. Use symbols from Unicode’s Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols block liberally to produce facsimiles of bold, italics, line separation, and other formatting. Examples for a sample sentence:

italics sans: 𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘘𝘶𝘪𝘤𝘬 𝘉𝘳𝘰𝘸𝘯 𝘍𝘰𝘹 𝘑𝘶𝘮𝘱𝘦𝘥 𝘖𝘷𝘦𝘳 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘭𝘢𝘻𝘺 𝘥𝘰𝘨.

bold italic sans: 𝙏𝙝𝙚 𝙌𝙪𝙞𝙘𝙠 𝘽𝙧𝙤𝙬𝙣 𝙁𝙤𝙭 𝙅𝙪𝙢𝙥𝙚𝙙 𝙊𝙫𝙚𝙧 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙡𝙖𝙯𝙮 𝙙𝙤𝙜.
italics serif: 𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝑄𝑢𝑖𝑐𝑘 𝐵𝑟𝑜𝑤𝑛 𝐹𝑜𝑥 𝐽𝑢𝑚𝑝𝑒𝑑 𝑂𝑣𝑒𝑟 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑙𝑎𝑧𝑦 𝑑𝑜𝑔.

The response should have the next format:
